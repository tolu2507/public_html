    <p class="last-updated">Infin8 Hub FZ-LLC<br/>Security Information Statement<br/>Last Updated: 8/AUG/2024</p>

    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>Infin8 Hub FZ-LLC is committed to maintaining the highest standards of information security, data protection, and operational resilience across all our technology solutions. As a technology provider serving businesses across various industries, we recognize the critical importance of safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of both our clients' and partners' data.</p>

    <p class="ps">1. Infrastructure and Data Security</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud Architecture:</strong> Our platforms are hosted in secure, industry-leading cloud environments with built-in redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities. All infrastructure components are managed following strict configuration and monitoring protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest (AES-256) using secure key management practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Backups:</strong> We perform automated, encrypted backups on a daily basis with geographically redundant storage to ensure data durability and continuity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ps">2. Access Management and Identity Controls</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> User access is assigned strictly on a least-privilege basis, with defined roles and permission levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enforced for all privileged accounts and administrative access.</li>
        <li><strong>Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Centralized audit logging and real-time monitoring tools are implemented to detect unauthorized access, system anomalies, or policy violations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ps">3. Application and Software Security</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):</strong> All software is developed in accordance with industry standards such as the OWASP Top 10. Code is peer-reviewed and tested before deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Static and Dynamic Scanning:</strong> Continuous integration pipelines include automated vulnerability scanning of source code and runtime environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> We conduct regular third-party penetration tests to assess our applications, APIs, and infrastructure for exploitable vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ps">4. Network and Perimeter Protection</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firewalls and Intrusion Detection:</strong> We employ next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) to monitor and control network traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> Network segmentation is applied to isolate environments, limiting the scope of any potential breach.</li>
        <li><strong>DDoS Mitigation:</strong> Our infrastructure includes protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks through upstream filtering and rate-limiting.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ps">5. Compliance and Governance</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security Policies:</strong> Infin8hub maintains a comprehensive set of internal security policies reviewed annually and enforced through automated controls and staff training.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Compliance:</strong> We align with international privacy regulations and best practices, including the principles of data minimization, purpose limitation, and secure data handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Vendor Risk Management:</strong> All third-party service providers are subject to security assessments and must meet predefined risk and compliance criteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ps">6. Incident Response and Business Continuity</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Incident Response Plan (IRP):</strong> We maintain a documented IRP that includes detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Continuity Planning (BCP):</strong> Critical services are supported by continuity plans, tested periodically to ensure readiness in the event of a disruption.</li>
        <li><strong>Client Notification Protocol:</strong> In the event of a data incident affecting client systems or data, we follow a structured communication protocol in compliance with applicable legal and contractual obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ps">7. Continuous Improvement</p>
    <p>We are committed to continuously improving our security posture by investing in new technologies, conducting regular audits, and staying informed about emerging threats and industry trends.</p>
